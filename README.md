# foxplot

Have you ever looked at a string and wondered, which letter is the most popular? Well wonder no more... Feed the string to foxplot and foxplot will tell you useful things like how many letters it contains, which letter is the most popular, and will even burp out a frequency proportion histogram for your perusal.

To compile, just run:
$ gcc foxplot.c -o foxplot
$ .\foxplot "My string goes here!"

For example, if you were to run:
$ .\foxplot "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
You would see:
![Example1](example1.jpg?raw=true "Quick Brown Fox Screenshot")
